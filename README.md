# Contour Terminal Emulator Ports overlay

FreeBSD port overlay (for poudriere) for [Contour](https://github.com/contour-terminal/contour). 
You can also just build it by going into the x11/contour directory and typing `make install`. This requires a checked-out ports tree at `/usr/ports`.

Once there is a stable release that builds on FreeBSD this might go into ports.
